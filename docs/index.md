# KinesinLMS

KinesinLMS is a simple open-source Learning Management System (LMS) built with the sole developer in mind.

It's written in Django and tries hard to make it easy for a single developer (or small development team) to understand
things quickly, get things set up with minimal fuss, and remain free to extend the app in novel ways.

The key features are:

- **Simple**: "Just enough" LMS to get you started on creating something interesting and engaging. It's not a
  full-featured LMS, but it's a good starting point.
- **Grokkable**: A primary focus of KinesinLMS is to fit entirely inside one developer's head. It tries hard to avoid
  complex frameworks and dependencies, and to keep the codebase small and understandable. For example, more HTMx, less
  React.
- **Forgettable**: For those dependencies and infrastrucutre components that are necessary, KinesinLMS tries to use
  basic, boring, tried-and-true dependencies to do cool things. Boostrap for styling, only one postgres database for all
  things storage, etc. When you forget how a dependency or compontent works, it should be easy to look up and remember.
