# Installation Overview

KinesinLMS is a Django application implemented using teh best practices and conventions established by
the (most excellent) [Django cookie-cutter](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter-django)
project.

So setting it up is similar to setting up any Django project built from Django cookie-cutter, but with a few extra
steps.
